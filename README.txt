I have done and included the optional task (coursework 4) with Javascript, both the form validation and the sort/filter function.
Sort by price will sort the dessert by lowest first
Sort by name will sort them alphabetical of title starting from A.
Sort by description will sort them the alphabetical of description starting from A.
The sorting is made within the categories.
Ice creams can be filtered by category, using the checkboxes.
You can see my code in show-menu.js and database.js

I have made forms in the Reservation page and on the Contact page.
Its is only on the Reservation page that I have included validation on, regarding the coursework 4.
You can see my code in form-validator.js.

I have decided to use Flexbox on the header and the 3 "card" boxes on home and contact page.
I have not used Grid or flexbox any other places on the website, as it is not needed for this layout.

The background picture and the mail icon has CC0 Creative Commonsis. I have modified the picture by making it blury in photoshop.
I got the background picture from here: https://pixabay.com/no/iskrem-iskrembar-dessert-is-kaldt-410330/
And the mail icon from here: https://svgsilh.com/image/1332774.html

I got no errors in HTML or CSS validator but i got 2 warnings on reservations.html.
This is because I have used type="date" and type="time" on 2 Inputs.
They are not supportet on all browser, like Safari.
If a Browser that does not support this open the page, the input will change to type="text".
The format is explained in a paragraph above the input so users with not support broser can just write the date in the format that is explained.
I know this is not an optimal solution, but I havet fiqured out how to use third party solution for example to solve this as I found this out a little late.
Lesson learned, I should validate the codes early.
